# Build & Release Workflow

Document how to produce artifacts and publish them to your users.

## Pipelines

- Describe the build tools, CI/CD jobs, and environments involved.
- Note any secrets or credentials required along the way.

## Local Development

- Provide commands for running the full build on a developer workstation.
- Highlight the fastest feedback loop for common changes.

## Publishing

- Explain how releases are versioned and tagged.
- Document what triggers an APT repository update and how to validate it.

> 🔁 Keep this page current—stale build docs are worse than no docs.
