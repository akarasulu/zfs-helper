Description: ZFS delegation helper daemon for secure unprivileged ZFS operations
 A Linux OpenZFS delegation helper service that allows unprivileged systemd
 user-scoped services to securely request ZFS operations (mount, snapshot,
 rollback, create, destroy, rename, setprop, and share) on specific datasets
 and snapshots via a privileged socket-activated helper daemon.
 .
 The privileged gateway service securely overcomes delegation limitations
 resulting from ZFS ports to Linux. It follows a fine-grained user, operation,
 and delegate service policy with comprehensive audit logging.
 .
 This package contains the core daemon and systemd units that run with
 root privileges to perform ZFS operations on behalf of authorized
 unprivileged services.
